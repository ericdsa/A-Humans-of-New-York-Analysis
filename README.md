This program collects posts from a public page (Humans of New York) and predicts the like count for the next posts.

It works in the following process:
1) Collects the 100 most recent posts of Humans of New York from Facebook (NOTE: needs a valid Facebook API key not included in this repository)
2) Calculates a fit for the posts and predicts the next 20 posts.
3) Plots the original like counts and average like count on a webpage via GoogleVis, which formats it like a Google Chart.
